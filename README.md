## Free Exercise DB ðŸ’ª  &nbsp; [![Test, Lint & Deploy Site to Github Pages](https://github.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db/actions/workflows/ci.yaml) [![License: Unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-blue.svg)](http://unlicense.org/)

Open Public Domain Exercise Dataset in `JSON` format, 800+ exercises with a browsable public searchable frontend

### Why?

I started building another fitness related app and was looking for free/open source exercise lists and imagery I stumbled upon
[exercises.json](https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json) which was amazing though the data wasn't structured the way I wanted it and I also wanted a browsable/searchable frontend to the data inspired by [this issue](https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json/issues/5) so I restructured the data and built a simple frontend to it :)

### What do they look like?

General exercises are stored as single `JSON` documents with variations nested inside. They conform to the [general schema](./general_exercises/schema_general.json) eg.

```json
{
  "id": "Bench_Press",
  "name": "Bench Press",
  "variations": [
    {
      "id": "Bench_Press_-_Powerlifting",
      "name": "Bench Press - Powerlifting",
      "equipment": "barbell",
      "category": "powerlifting",
      "images": ["Bench_Press_-_Powerlifting/0.jpg", "Bench_Press_-_Powerlifting/1.jpg"]
    },
    {
      "id": "Dumbbell_Bench_Press",
      "name": "Dumbbell Bench Press",
      "equipment": "dumbbell",
      "category": "strength",
      "images": ["Dumbbell_Bench_Press/0.jpg", "Dumbbell_Bench_Press/1.jpg"]
    }
  ]
}
```
See [Bench_Press.json](./general_exercises/Bench_Press.json)

Generated variation files live in the `exercises` folder and the combined array
is written to `dist/exercises.json`. Add new variations by editing the
appropriate file in `general_exercises` and then run `make build-general` to
regenerate the outputs.

To further explore the data, you can use [lite.datasette.io](https://lite.datasette.io/?json=https://github.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db/blob/main/dist/exercises.json#/data/exercises?_facet_array=primaryMuscles&_facet=force&_facet=level&_facet=equipment)

### How do I use them?

You can check the repo out and use the `JSON` files and images locally

#### Alternatively

You can leverage github's hosting and access the single or combined [exercises.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db/main/dist/exercises.json) and prefix any of image path's contained in the `JSON` with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db/main/exercises/` to get a hosted version of the image eg. [Air_Bike/0.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db/main/exercises/Air_Bike/0.jpg) or leverage something like [imagekit.io](https://imagekit.io/) for dynamic image resizing which is utlized on the frontend [ example site ](https://github.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db/blob/main/site/src/components/PhotoGallery.vue#L44-L54)

### Build tasks
There are a number of helpful [Makefile](./Makefile) tasks that you can utilize

#### Linting
To lint all the variation files against the original [schema.json](./schema.json)
or validate the new general exercise format with
[schema_general.json](./general_exercises/schema_general.json) use

```
make lint
make lint-general
```

#### Combining into a single JSON file
If you make changes to any of the exercises or add new ones, to recombine all single `JSON` files into a single `JSON` containing an array of objects using the following make task

```sh
make dist/exercises.json
```
To regenerate the variation files from the definitions in `general_exercises` run

```sh
make build-general
```
_Note: requires [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)_

Example sequence after editing a general exercise:

```sh
make lint-general
make build-general
make dist/exercises.json
```

#### Importing into PostgreSQL
To combine all `JSON` files into [Newline Delimeted JSON](http://ndjson.org/) suitable for import into PostgreSQL use the following make task

```sh
make dist/exercises.nd.json
```
_Note: requires [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)_

### Browsable frontend

<img src="./site/public/screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of browsable frontend" width="500">

There is a simple searchable/browsable frontend to the data written in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)  available at [yuhonas.github.io/free-exercise-db](https://yuhonas.github.io/free-exercise-db/) all related code is in the [site](./site) directory


#### Setup

```sh
npm install
```

#### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

#### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

#### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

#### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

### TODO

#### Incomplete fields

The following fields are incomplete in _some_ `JSON` files and in such have had to allow `null` in [schema.json](./schema.json)

* force
* mechanic
* equipment

#### Images

There are also a small number of duplicate images eg.

```sh
jdupes --summarize --recurse .

Scanning: 2620 files, 874 items (in 1 specified)
25 duplicate files (in 22 sets), occupying 809 KB
```
